## Overview

FreshIcons was born out of a desire to create a space for *high-quality, hard-to-find icons and assets* that go beyond what standard libraries like Lucide or Feather provide.  

I wanted an elegant, modern shopping experience tailored to creatives ‚Äî smooth motion, clean interactions, and an interface that feels enjoyable to use.  

This project brings together authentication, payments, storage, and animation into one cohesive full-stack product.

## Getting Started (Local Development)

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS recommended)  
- npm, pnpm, or yarn  
- Stripe and Clerk accounts  
- Convex and Supabase projects for backend and storage  

---

### 1. Clone the repository

    git clone https://github.com/kelsiesmurphy/freshicons-frontend.git  
    cd freshicons-frontend

---

### 2. Install dependencies

    npm install  
    # or  
    yarn  
    # or  
    pnpm install

---

### 3. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root and include:

    # Clerk
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_XXXX
    CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_XXXX

    # Stripe
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_XXXX
    NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_XXXX
    STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_XXXX

    # Convex
    CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=dev:XXXX
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://your-convex-instance.convex.cloud

    # Supabase
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://XXXX.supabase.co
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=XXXX

    # App Config
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000

---

### 4. Run the development server

    npm run dev  
    # or  
    yarn dev  
    # or  
    pnpm dev

Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

---

## Scripts

- dev ‚Äî Start local development server  
- build ‚Äî Build for production  
- start ‚Äî Run production server  
- lint ‚Äî Run linting  
- test ‚Äî Run tests  

Example usage:

    pnpm run build  
    pnpm run dev

---

## Data & Security Considerations

- All keys (Clerk, Stripe, Convex, Supabase) should be kept private and never committed.  
- Stripe webhook handling should be verified via test mode before production.  
- Ensure Clerk origins and Stripe webhook URLs are properly configured.  

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Stripe payments failing:** Verify API keys and webhook secret.  
- **Auth errors:** Check Clerk origin settings and valid publishable keys.  
- **Asset loading issues:** Confirm Supabase public bucket permissions and file paths.
